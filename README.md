Challenge I made for cr0wn's Union CTF 2021, this was my first time writing something like this. It was very well recieved (solved by 26 teams) and i am honoured to have written a challenge for cr0wn and for a ctf of this high scale. This is not a solution to the challenge more of a repo to keep it intact to remember that i have written this :)
